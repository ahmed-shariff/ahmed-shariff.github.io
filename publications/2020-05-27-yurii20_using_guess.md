abstract: 'Mid-air gestures have been heavily studied in HCI but with mostly younger adults (YAs). Older adults (OAs) can equally benefit from such a modality, but given their heterogeneous motor abilities, designing suitable gestures is challenging [2]. Our research specifically looks at age-related differences in hand gesture preferences between older and younger adults. This subject is important since it relates to the idea of a proper age-inclusive technological design and the means towards the successful adoption of technologies by all the layers of the population, including older adults.'
