<p class="message">
     Hey there! Thanks for coming to this obscure corner of the internet to visit my site. This site is work in progress. So be patient, I'll update here soon.
</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">Hello there ....</h3>
<p>I am Ahmed Shariff, in case you didn't know ;). A tech enthusiast, a believer in the power of technology. My primary interest is in artificial intelligence. Everything about it interests me, from it's illusive definition, the philosophy behind it, the impact it has and will have on the human race to how it is done and the technicalities of building an intelligence. My current focus is around machine learning, particularly deep learning and ...... pretty much everything about it.</p>
<p>Currently I am working at the University of Peradeniya on a industry collaboration project with CodeGen International. The project was started to study and develop AI systems. Currently, the focus of my work is on using deep learning and computer vision technologies to automate various aspects of a restaurant.</p>
