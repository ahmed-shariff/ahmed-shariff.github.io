Coz I am lazy?

Before you judge let me refer you to this reddit [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/quotes/comments/1csuc6/i_choose_a_lazy_person_to_do_a_hard_job_because_a/c9js7rb/):
> "I divide my officers into four groups. There are clever, diligent, stupid, and lazy officers. Usually two characteristics are combined. Some are clever and diligent -- their place is the General Staff. The next lot are stupid and lazy -- they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both ***clever and lazy** is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the intellectual clarity and the composure necessary for difficult decisions*. One must beware of anyone who is stupid and diligent -- he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always cause only mischief."
