Incorporating force sensitivity, three-state virtual keyboards can utilize a force threshold to better classify a contact event. However, our limited knowledge of how force plays a role during typing on virtual keyboards limits further progress. Through a series of studies we observe that using a uniform threshold is not an optimal approach. Furthermore, the force being applied while typing varies significantly across the keys and among participants. As such, we propose three different approaches to further improve the uniform threshold. We show that a carefully selected non-uniform threshold function could be sufficient in delineating typing events on a three-state keyboard. Finally, we conclude our work with lessons learned, suggestion for future improvements, and comparisons with current methods available.","pdf":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3580915?cid=99659534363"},"content":"\n```latex\n@inproceedings{10.1145/3544548.3580915,\nauthor = {Faleel, Shariff AM and Liu, Yishuo and Cody, Roya A and Rey, Bradley and Du, Linghao and Yu, Jiangyue and Huang, Da-Yuan and Irani, Pourang and Li, Wei},\ntitle = {T-Force: Exploring the Use of Typing Force for Three State Virtual Keyboards},\nyear = {2023},\nisbn = {9781450394215},\npublisher = {Association for Computing Machinery},\naddress = {New York, NY, USA},\nurl = {https://doi.org/10.1145/3544548.3580915},\ndoi = {10.1145/3544548.3580915},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 2023 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems},\narticleno = {723},\nnumpages = {15},\nkeywords = {10-finger typing, force sensitive touch interactions, three-state Virtual keyboard},\nlocation = {Hamburg, Germany},\nseries = {CHI '23}\n}\n```\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
