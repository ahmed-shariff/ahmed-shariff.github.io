Space-time cube (STC) has been commonly used to visualize this data to support analytic tasks. However, the current STC visualization tools are currently not compatible with situated platforms since these tools are often designed for desktop computing. Thus, we propose a situated space-time cube analytics (SSCA) prototype that maps spatio-temporal trajectory data into the environment where the data was captured. Being situated in such an environment while exploring data can provide benefits, and further allows us to explore interaction techniques such as proxemics and embodied interaction. We are confident that with SSCA, and a new generation of augmented reality technologies, researchers can begin to better explore the potential of situated STC analytics.","pdf":"/pdf/alallah22_ssca.pdf"},"excerpt":""},{"slug":"2022-05-21-lit-mangaement","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","comments":true,"title":"Reference Management: What am I managing?","tags":["org","emacs","reference-management"],"tagline":"Documenting the features of my reference management system along with a wish list."},"excerpt":""},{"slug":"2022-05-02-oculus_setup","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","comments":true,"title":"Setting up Oculus Quest 2 for development with Unity","tags":["oculus","vr","guide"],"tagline":"Step-by-step guide to setting up oculus for development with unity."},"excerpt":""},{"slug":"2022-04-19-nextjs-gh-pages","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","comments":true,"title":"Personal website with nextjs and github pages","tags":["javascript","react","next","guide"],"tagline":"Summery of how I went about setting up my personal website which with markdown blog on github pages using nextjs."},"excerpt":""},{"slug":"2021-08-27-pub-shariff21_hpui","frontmatter":{"title":"HPUI: Hand Proximate User Interfaces for One-Handed Interactions on Head Mounted Displays","date":"2021-08-27","authors":"<b>Shariff AM Faleel</b>; Michael Gammon; Kevin Fan; Da-Yuan Huang; Wei Li; Pourang Irani","venue":"TVCG (ISMAR '21)","type":"Journal","paperurl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2021.3106493","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3106493","citation":"S.

We focus on single-handed input, while taking into consideration the hand anatomy which distorts naturally when the user interacts with the display. Through two user studies, we explore the potential for discrete as well as continuous input. For discrete input, HPUIs favor targets that are directly on the fingers (as opposed to off-finger) as they offer tactile feedback. We demonstrate that continuous interaction is also possible, and is as effective on the fingers as in the off-finger space between the index finger and thumb. We also find that with continuous input, content is more easily controlled when the interaction occurs in the vertical or horizontal axes, and less with diagonal movements. We conclude with applications and recommendations for the design of future HPUIs.","pdf":"/pdf/shariff21_hpui.pdf"},"excerpt":""}]},"__N_SSG":true}
