Specifically, we examine one-handed inputs where the main mode of interaction is thumb-to-finger contact. Our focus is on the user interface (UI) design of these displays, and we aim to develop design guidelines and heuristics for this novel design space. To achieve this, we conducted a participatory design study involving 15 participants who provided feedback on 120 different design examples, as well as their thoughts surrounding the HPUI design. Participants favored designs that were ergonomically comfortable and flexible, and those that provided clear visibility regardless of hand positioning. Based on this feedback, we developed 7 design guidelines for Hand Proximate User Interfaces. In applying these guidelines we find that common application interfaces can easily be accommodated using HPUI for use on head-mounted displays.","pdf":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3563657.3596117?cid=99659534363","thumbnail":"/assets/2023-07-08/TeaserFigure.png","thumbnailDescription":"These 16 hand-proximate user interfaces serve as examples to help participants understand the possible designs they can create. The interfaces are organized into different rows, each representing a specific application. For instance, the third row depicts a map application, where the first three columns exhibit distinct map navigation or display styles. The first column demonstrates a detached display with joystick control, the second features a touchpad swipe control, and the third showcases a continuous display and combined input surface. The fourth column portrays a submenu that provides additional options, such as inputting directions"},"excerpt":""},{"slug":"2023-03-04-pub-faleel23_t_force","frontmatter":{"title":"T-Force: Exploring the Use of Typing Force for Three State Virtual Keyboards","date":"2023-04-23","authors":"<b>Shariff AM Faleel</b>, Yishuo Liu, Roya A Cody, Bradley Rey, Linghao Du, Jiangyue Yu, Da-Yuan Huang, Pourang Irani, Wei Li","venue":"CHI '23","type":"Conference","paperurl":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3580915","doi":"10.1145/3544548.3580915","citation":"Shariff AM Faleel, Yishuo Liu, Roya A Cody, Bradley Rey, Linghao Du, Jiangyue Yu, Da-Yuan Huang, Pourang Irani, and Wei Li. 2023.

Incorporating force sensitivity, three-state virtual keyboards can utilize a force threshold to better classify a contact event. However, our limited knowledge of how force plays a role during typing on virtual keyboards limits further progress. Through a series of studies we observe that using a uniform threshold is not an optimal approach. Furthermore, the force being applied while typing varies significantly across the keys and among participants. As such, we propose three different approaches to further improve the uniform threshold. We show that a carefully selected non-uniform threshold function could be sufficient in delineating typing events on a three-state keyboard. Finally, we conclude our work with lessons learned, suggestion for future improvements, and comparisons with current methods available.","pdf":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3580915?cid=99659534363"},"excerpt":""},{"slug":"2022-09-18-profiling_loading_org_files-2","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","comments":true,"title":"Profiling file loading times for org mode (part 2)","tags":["emacs","org"],"tagline":"Trying to figure out why the load times with my config is much higher."},"excerpt":""},{"slug":"2022-09-16-profiling_loading_org_files","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","comments":true,"title":"Profiling file loading times for org mode","tags":["emacs","org"],"tagline":"The loading times of files was starting to become an issue as I started switching to the 'one file per note` approach in my org-roam database.

To design our technique, we first conducted a user study to answer which segments of the smartwatch display have the least screen occlusion while users are interacting with it. We use results from the first experiment to introduce EdgeSelect, a three-layer non-linear interaction technique, which can be used to interact with multiple co-adjacent graphs on the smartwatch by using a region that is the least prone to finger occlusion. In a second experiment, we explore the density limits of the targets possible with EdgeSelect. Finally, we demonstrate the generalizability of EdgeSelect to interact with various types of content.","pdf":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3536221.3556586?cid=99659534363"},"excerpt":""}]},"__N_SSG":true}
