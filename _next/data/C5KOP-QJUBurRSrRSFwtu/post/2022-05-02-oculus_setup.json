Note that when not using a facebook account some functionalities in the quest would not be available, for example, you won't be able to use any other app than the ones you develop.\n    - Go to [https://developer.oculus.com/manage/verify/](https://developer.oculus.com/manage/verify/) and add your contact number to verify your oculus developer account.

Note that this will not allow you to use apps other than the ones you develop.\n            - Go to [https://developer.oculus.com/manage/organizations/](https://developer.oculus.com/manage/organizations/) and select the organization you created. \n            - Select Test Users\n            - Select Add Test User\n            - Provide dummy details\n            - Create test account\n            - Use the email shown and password used to login to the oculus app on the mobile phone\n        - Skip the payment detail section\n        - Note that to switch account after you pair a device, you'll have to [do a factory reset](https://support.oculus.com/articles/fix-a-problem/troubleshoot-headsets-and-accessories/troubleshooting-factory-reset-quest-2/).\n    - Make sure the headset is [charged, turned on and properly adjusted to fit you](https://support.oculus.com/526118881723537). \n    - You'd need to enable bluetooth on your mobile device and have the headset nearby\n    - After going through the steps of setting up the mobile app, you'd be prompted to select a headset, pick the Oculus Quest 2 to pair devices.
