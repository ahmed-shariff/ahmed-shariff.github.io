Specifically, we examine one-handed inputs where the main mode of interaction is thumb-to-finger contact. Our focus is on the user interface (UI) design of these displays, and we aim to develop design guidelines and heuristics for this novel design space. To achieve this, we conducted a participatory design study involving 15 participants who provided feedback on 120 different design examples, as well as their thoughts surrounding the HPUI design. Participants favored designs that were ergonomically comfortable and flexible, and those that provided clear visibility regardless of hand positioning. Based on this feedback, we developed 7 design guidelines for Hand Proximate User Interfaces. In applying these guidelines we find that common application interfaces can easily be accommodated using HPUI for use on head-mounted displays.","pdf":"/pdf/holfeld23_eval_desig_study.pdf","thumbnail":"/assets/2023-07-08/TeaserFigure.png","thumbnailDescription":"These 16 hand-proximate user interfaces serve as examples to help participants understand the possible designs they can create. The interfaces are organized into different rows, each representing a specific application. For instance, the third row depicts a map application, where the first three columns exhibit distinct map navigation or display styles. The first column demonstrates a detached display with joystick control, the second features a touchpad swipe control, and the third showcases a continuous display and combined input surface. The fourth column portrays a submenu that provides additional options, such as inputting directions"},"content":"\n```latex\n@inproceedings{10.1145/3563657.3596117,\nauthor = {Perella-Holfeld, Francisco and Faleel, Shariff AM and Irani, Pourang},\ntitle = {Evaluating Design Guidelines for Hand Proximate User Interfaces},\nyear = {2023},\nisbn = {9781450398930},\npublisher = {Association for Computing Machinery},\naddress = {New York, NY, USA},\nurl = {https://doi.org/10.1145/3563657.3596117},\ndoi = {10.1145/3563657.3596117},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 2023 ACM Designing Interactive Systems Conference},\npages = {1159–1173},\nnumpages = {15},\nkeywords = {Hand Proximate User Interface, Design Guidelines, Head Mounted Displays},\nlocation = {Pittsburgh, PA, USA},\nseries = {DIS '23}\n}\n```\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
