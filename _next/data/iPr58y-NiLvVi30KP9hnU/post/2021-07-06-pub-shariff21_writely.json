In this work we have developed two different force feedback modalities, Guidance and Anti-Guidance. Through a preliminary exploration, our early results shed light on the potential of Anti-Guidance and a low cost, planar, haptic device specifically for writing motor skill training.","pdf":"/pdf/shariff21_writely.pdf"},"content":"\n```latex\n@inproceedings{shariff21_writely,\n   author={Faleel, Shariff Am and Raj Joshi, Bibhushan and Rey, Bradley},\n   booktitle={2021 IEEE World Haptics Conference (WHC)},\n   title={Writely: Force Feedback for Non-Dominant Hand Writing Training},\n   year={2021},\n   volume={},\n   number={},\n   pages={340-340},\n   doi={10.1109/WHC49131.2021.9517209}\n}\n```\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
