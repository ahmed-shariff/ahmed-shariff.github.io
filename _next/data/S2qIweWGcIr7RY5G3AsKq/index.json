To design our technique, we first conducted a user study to answer which segments of the smartwatch display have the least screen occlusion while users are interacting with it. We use results from the first experiment to introduce EdgeSelect, a three-layer non-linear interaction technique, which can be used to interact with multiple co-adjacent graphs on the smartwatch by using a region that is the least prone to finger occlusion. In a second experiment, we explore the density limits of the targets possible with EdgeSelect. Finally, we demonstrate the generalizability of EdgeSelect to interact with various types of content.","pdf":"/pdf/ali22_edgeselect.pdf"},"excerpt":""},{"slug":"2022-06-13-pub-alallah22_ssca","frontmatter":{"title":"SSCA: Situated Space-time Cube Analytics","date":"2022-06-13","authors":"Fouad Alallah, <b>Shariff AM Faleel</b>, Yumiko Sakamoto, Bradley Rey, Pourang Irani","venue":"EuroVis '22","type":"Conference","paperurl":"https://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/evs20221088","doi":"10.2312/evs20221088","citation":"Alallah, F., Faleel, S., Sakamoto, Y., Rey, B., & Irani, P.

Space-time cube (STC) has been commonly used to visualize this data to support analytic tasks. However, the current STC visualization tools are currently not compatible with situated platforms since these tools are often designed for desktop computing. Thus, we propose a situated space-time cube analytics (SSCA) prototype that maps spatio-temporal trajectory data into the environment where the data was captured. Being situated in such an environment while exploring data can provide benefits, and further allows us to explore interaction techniques such as proxemics and embodied interaction. We are confident that with SSCA, and a new generation of augmented reality technologies, researchers can begin to better explore the potential of situated STC analytics.","pdf":"/pdf/alallah22_ssca.pdf"},"excerpt":""},{"slug":"2022-05-21-lit-mangaement","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","comments":true,"title":"Reference Management: What am I managing?","tags":["org","emacs","reference-management"],"tagline":"Documenting the features of my reference management system along with a wish list."},"excerpt":""},{"slug":"2022-05-02-oculus_setup","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","comments":true,"title":"Setting up Oculus Quest 2 for development with Unity","tags":["oculus","vr","guide"],"tagline":"Step-by-step guide to setting up oculus for development with unity."},"excerpt":""}]},"__N_SSG":true}
