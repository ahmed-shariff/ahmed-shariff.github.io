In this work, a novel dialogue manager based on user input learning is proposed to overcome this issue. In the proposed model back-end functionality is considered as a set of functions a user can trigger through the dialogue manager. It uses these functions as classes for the classification of user inputs. To maintain the context of the dialogue interactions, a context tree is used. Consequently, the model performs its task as two classification tasks to identify the function a user input may trigger and use the context to maintain the discourse of the dialogue. The model shows promising results and proves that a dialogue manager can be integrated into a spoken dialogue system much more directly with less hassle.","pdf":"/pdf/shariff19_dialog_manager.pdf"},"content":"\r\n```latex\r\n@InProceedings{shariff19_dialog_manager,\r\n   author=\"Ahmed Shariff, M.
