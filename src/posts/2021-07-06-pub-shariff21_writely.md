abstract: 'We propose Writely, a haptic force feedback system that uses Haply force feedback device for training non-dominant hand writing. In this work we have developed two different force feedback modalities, Guidance and Anti-Guidance. Through a preliminary exploration, our early results shed light on the potential of Anti-Guidance and a low cost, planar, haptic device specifically for writing motor skill training.'
