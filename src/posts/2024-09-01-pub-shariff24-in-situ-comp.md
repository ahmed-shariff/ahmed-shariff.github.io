abstract: "We explore the value of Hand Proximate User Interfaces (HPUIs)for in-situ interactive head-mounted systems, i.e. systems designed to support a user’s primary activity. HPUIs are unencumbered, single-handed, and have tactile and proprioceptive affordances. This allows novice and expert users to rely on the visual cues avail-able in the UI, but to then gradually interact eyes-free such that theyminimize interrupting the user’s core task. Prior work on HPUI falls short of validating this premise. We address this gap with compar-ative analysis in the context of a compound task, where one hand isinvolved in a primary task and the second interacts with a secondarybut supporting task (e.g. selecting items from a menu). We com-pare HPUI with mid-air direct interactions, a common form of in-teracting with head-mounted displays. The results show that HPUIperforms similarly to mid-air but with better eyes-free affordancesand user preferences"
