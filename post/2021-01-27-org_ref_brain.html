<p>The idea is as follows: When I come across a paper that I am interested, I add it to the database, which involves three things:</p>

<li>Creates a bib entry in my master bib file</li>
<li>Creates a org heading in my bib notes file</li>

When I want to reference a paper from a latex or org file, I'd use reftex and <a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref">org-ref</a> which would be pointing to the master bib file when I am editing them. The most satisfying part is when I can directly open the pdf of a paper and the related notes directly from an <code>cite</code> entry in the latex file. On top of that, in order to classify and manage the different topics, I use <a href="https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain">org-brain</a> which is a variant of concept mapping which uses org-mode. On top of this I also have a org-mode based system for managing my projects and taking related notes. It also being part of org-mode and my <code>org-brain</code> setup, allows me to easily reference papers related to implementations or the other way around, which is a topic for another day.</p>

<p>For brevity I am linking the functions to my dot files on github (Anyone who does go through that file, I apologize for the chaos it is; but then again, &quot;a clean emacs config is an empty emacs config&quot;, so....).

<p>Typically, I use <code>org-ref</code>'s <code>crossref-add-bibtex-entry</code> to add a paper to the database. I still haven't figured out a consistant way to directly download papers through my networks, so I add the url as a <code>LINK</code> propoery. At this stage I have the paper in the bib file and the org file, to link the entry with <code>org-brain</code> and <code>org-noter</code> I execute the <a href="https://github.com/ahmed-shariff/dotfiles/blob/c8bcf49703a66adf14469ab9b8a3d36c4c56bcb8/.emacs.d/customFiles/orgZ.el#L580"><code>research-papers-configure</code></a> function. To attach the paper to any relevant topic in org-brain, I use the function <a href="https://github.com/ahmed-shariff/dotfiles/blob/c8bcf49703a66adf14469ab9b8a3d36c4c56bcb8/.emacs.d/customFiles/orgZ.el#L719"><code>org-brain-add-parent-topic</code></a> which filters the <code>org-brain</code> entries to topics. When I want to keep track of the papers I have worked on and the ones I want to work on, I use <code>org-mode</code>s todo lists, which I also expose to the <code>org-brain</code> interface which shows the todo state (more details on this can be found in <a href="https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain/issues/227">this issue</a>). On top of this I also have a few convenience functions for the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opening a pdf file directly from the <code>org-brain</code> window: <a href="https://github.com/ahmed-shariff/dotfiles/blob/c8bcf49703a66adf14469ab9b8a3d36c4c56bcb8/.emacs.d/customFiles/orgZ.el#L357"><code>org-brain-open-org-noter</code></a></li>
<li>Opening an child buttons entry in <code>org-brain</code> without going to the entry in <code>org-brain</code>: <a href="https://github.com/ahmed-shariff/dotfiles/blob/c8bcf49703a66adf14469ab9b8a3d36c4c56bcb8/.emacs.d/customFiles/orgZ.el#L729"><code>org-brain-goto-button-at-pt</code></a></li>

<li>Export all papers and notes related to a specific topic, which I use when I am sharing related papers with co-authors: <a href="https://github.com/ahmed-shariff/dotfiles/blob/c8bcf49703a66adf14469ab9b8a3d36c4c56bcb8/.emacs.d/customFiles/orgZ.el#L653"><code>copy-related-research-paper-notes</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/ahmed-shariff/dotfiles/blob/c8bcf49703a66adf14469ab9b8a3d36c4c56bcb8/.emacs.d/customFiles/orgZ.el#L626"><code>copy-related-research-papers</code></a></li>
<li>Simplify adding papers from arxiv (because it's more consistent and free to download directly): <a href="https://github.com/ahmed-shariff/dotfiles/blob/c8bcf49703a66adf14469ab9b8a3d36c4c56bcb8/.emacs.d/customFiles/orgZ.el#L678"><code>arxiv-add-bibtex-entry-with-note</code></a></li>
<li>Abstract deletion of pdf file and related cleanup: <a href="https://github.com/ahmed-shariff/dotfiles/blob/c8bcf49703a66adf14469ab9b8a3d36c4c56bcb8/.emacs.d/customFiles/orgZ.el#L754"><code>org-brain-delete-interleve-entry</code></a></li>
<li>When reading a pdf file:
<ul>
<li>Add highlighted text as quoted notes (alternative to highlighting on the pdf): <a href="https://github.com/ahmed-shariff/dotfiles/blob/c8bcf49703a66adf14469ab9b8a3d36c4c56bcb8/.emacs.d/customFiles/orgZ.el#L541"><code>org-noter-copy-text-as-note</code></a></li>
<li>Crop a part of the pdf and store it as an image (parts of them still experimental): <a href="https://github.com/ahmed-shariff/dotfiles/blob/c8bcf49703a66adf14469ab9b8a3d36c4c56bcb8/.emacs.d/customFiles/orgZ.el#L493"><code>pdf-crop-image</code></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using <code>org-ql</code> for querying papers based on topics: <a href="https://github.com/ahmed-shariff/dotfiles/blob/c8bcf49703a66adf14469ab9b8a3d36c4c56bcb8/.emacs.d/customFiles/orgZ.el#L466"><code>org-brain-query-papers</code></a></li>
