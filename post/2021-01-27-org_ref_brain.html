<p>Typically, I use <code>org-ref</code>'s <code>crossref-add-bibtex-entry</code> to add a paper to the database. I still haven't figured out a consistant way to directly download papers through my networks, so I add the url as a <code>LINK</code> propoery. At this stage I have the paper in the bib file and the org file, to link the entry with <code>org-brain</code> and <code>org-noter</code> I execute the <a href="https://github.com/ahmed-shariff/dotfiles/blob/c8bcf49703a66adf14469ab9b8a3d36c4c56bcb8/.emacs.d/customFiles/orgZ.el#L580"><code>research-papers-configure</code></a> function. To attach the paper to any relevant topic in org-brain, I use the function <a href="https://github.com/ahmed-shariff/dotfiles/blob/c8bcf49703a66adf14469ab9b8a3d36c4c56bcb8/.emacs.d/customFiles/orgZ.el#L719"><code>org-brain-add-parent-topic</code></a> which filters the <code>org-brain</code> entries to topics. When I want to keep track of the papers I have worked on and the ones I want to work on, I use <code>org-mode</code>s todo lists, which I also expose to the <code>org-brain</code> interface which shows the todo state (more details on this can be found in <a href="https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain/issues/227">this issue</a>). On top of this I also have a few convenience functions for the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opening a pdf file directly from the <code>org-brain</code> window: <a href="https://github.com/ahmed-shariff/dotfiles/blob/c8bcf49703a66adf14469ab9b8a3d36c4c56bcb8/.emacs.d/customFiles/orgZ.el#L357"><code>org-brain-open-org-noter</code></a></li>

<li>When reading a pdf file:

<li>Add highlighted text as quoted notes (alternative to highlighting on the pdf): <a href="https://github.com/ahmed-shariff/dotfiles/blob/c8bcf49703a66adf14469ab9b8a3d36c4c56bcb8/.emacs.d/customFiles/orgZ.el#L541"><code>org-noter-copy-text-as-note</code></a></li>
<li>Crop a part of the pdf and store it as an image (parts of them still experimental): <a href="https://github.com/ahmed-shariff/dotfiles/blob/c8bcf49703a66adf14469ab9b8a3d36c4c56bcb8/.emacs.d/customFiles/orgZ.el#L493"><code>pdf-crop-image</code></a></li>
