<blockquote>
<p>The Computational theory of mind resolves the paradox. It says that beliefs and desires are information, incarnated as the configurations of symbols. The symbols are the physical states of the bits of matter, like chips in a computer or neurons in the brain. They symbolize things in the world because they are triggered by those things via our sense organs and because of what they do once they are triggered. If the bits of matter that constitute a symbol in just the right way, the symbols corresponding to one belief can give raise to new symbols corresponding to another belief logically related to it, which can give rise to symbols corresponding to other beliefs, and so on. Eventually the bit of matter constituting a symbol bump into bits of matter connected to the muscles, and behavior happens.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just as it is easy to multiply some numbers and announce the product but impossible to take a product and announce the numbers that were multiplied to get it, optics is easy but inverse optics is impossible. Yet your brain does it every time you open the refrigerator and pull out a jar. How can this be? The answer is that <em>the brain supplies the missing information</em>, information about the world we evolved in and how it reflects light.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Page 35:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The families of neurons that will form the different mental organs, all descendants of a homogeneous stretch of embryonic tissue, must be designed to be opportunistic as the brain assembles itself, seizing any available information to differentiate from one another. The coordinates in the skull may be on trigger for differentiation, bu the pattern of input firings from connected neurons is another. Since the brain is destined to be an organ of computation, it would be surprising if the genome did not exploit the capacity of neural tissue to process information during brain assembly. ... To make precise connections, though, the baby neurons must begin to function, and their firing patters carries information downstream about their pinpoint connections. This isn't &quot;experience&quot;, ... brains modules assume their identity by combination of what kind of tissue they start out as, where they are in the brain, and what patterns of triggering input they get during critical periods in development.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our goals are subgoals of the ultimate goal of the genes. ... sometimes the most selfish thing a gene can do is to build a selfless brain. Genes are a play within a play, not the interior monologue of the players.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Page 62:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Intelligence, then, is the ability to attain goals in the face of obstacles by means of decisions based on rational (truth-obeying) rules. ... intelligence consists of specifying a goal, assessing the current situation to see how it differs from the goal and applying a set  of operations that reduce the difference. ... We have a set of desires, and we pursue them using beliefs, which when all goes well, are at least approximately or probabilistically true.</p>

<p>Intelligence comes from a different commodity, information. Information is a correlation between two things that is produced by a lawful process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our rational machine owes it's rationality to two properties glued together in the entity we call a symbol: a symbol carries information, and it causes things to happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If one string of words in English can correspond to two meanings in the mind, meaning in the mind cannot be strings of words in English. Sentences in a spoken language are cluttered with grammatical boilerplate. They are needed to help get information from one head to another by way of the mouth and the ear, a slow channel, but they are not needed inside the head where information can be transmitted directly by thick bundles of neurons. So the statements in a knowledge system are not sentences in English but rather inscriptions in a richer language of thought, &quot;mentalese&quot;</p>
