<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I divide my officers into four groups. There are clever, diligent, stupid, and lazy officers. Usually two characteristics are combined. Some are clever and diligent -- their place is the General Staff. The next lot are stupid and lazy -- they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both <em><strong>clever and lazy</strong> is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the intellectual clarity and the composure necessary for difficult decisions</em>. One must beware of anyone who is stupid and diligent -- he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always cause only mischief.&quot;</p>
